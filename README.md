# Human Protein Classification


This is a work of [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jovian-pytorch-z2g). We have to develop models capable of classifying mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. The human protein will use these models to build a tool integrated with its smart-microscopy system to identify a protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image.

> Images visualizing proteins in cells are commonly used for biomedical research, and these cells could hold the key for the next breakthrough in medicine. However, thanks to advances in high-throughput microscopy, these images are generated at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated. Therefore, the need is greater than ever for automating biomedical image analysis to accelerate the understanding of human cells and disease.
